## About

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of <a href="http://matterwave.physics.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Holger MÃ¼ller</a> in the <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Physics Department</a> at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a>.

I am interested in developing new methods to explore the structure and spatio-temporal dynamics of molecules, particularly in the context of biological systems. My current research is focused on developing <a href="https://matterwave.physics.berkeley.edu/phase-contrast-electron-microscopy" target="_blank">phase-contrast electron microscopy using a high-power optical cavity</a>.

Prior to my postdoctoral work, I received my Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry in the group of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/moerner/" target="_blank">W. E. Moerner</a> at <a href="https://chemistry.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Stanford</a>, where I developed experimental and computational methods to <a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13676745" target="_blank">quantify and improve the precision and accuracy of three-dimensional single-molecule localization microscopy</a>. Before that, I received a B.S. in <a href="https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/home" target="_blank">Chemistry from UC Berkeley</a>.
