## About

I am an <a href="https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships/F32" target="_blank">NIH F32 Postdoctoral Fellow</a> in the group of <a href="http://matterwave.physics.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Holger MÃ¼ller</a> in the <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Physics Department</a> at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a>.

I am broadly interested in the fields of imaging, spectroscopy, and signal processing, especially with applications to the study of molecules. My current research is focused on developing phase contrast electron microscopy using a high-power optical cavity. In 2020, I completed a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry in the group of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/moerner/" target="_blank">W. E. Moerner</a> at <a href="https://chemistry.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Stanford</a>, where I developed experimental and computational methods to quantify and improve the precision and accuracy of three-dimensional single-molecule localization microscopy. Before that, I received a B.S. in <a href="https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/home" target="_blank">Chemistry from UC Berkeley</a>.
